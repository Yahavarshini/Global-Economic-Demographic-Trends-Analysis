# 🌍 Global Economic and Demographic Trends Analysis

## 📄 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing global data related to population, GDP, literacy, health, and migration using **Power BI**. The dataset is derived from both **SQL** and **Excel** sources and includes over 50 years of historical data (1960–2017). The objective is to uncover meaningful insights about countries and regions through data cleaning, transformation, statistical analysis, and interactive dashboards.

A total of **9 dashboards** were created to present trends and comparisons across key indicators such as population, GDP per capita, literacy rate, infant mortality, net migration, and more.

## 🎯 Objective

- Connect multiple data sources (Excel and SQL) into Power BI.
- Clean, transform, and prepare data for analysis.
- Perform descriptive statistics and time series calculations.
- Create interactive and insightful dashboards.
- Derive patterns and relationships between key development indicators.

---

## 📌 Scope

- Analyze population growth and density trends.
- Explore GDP and GDP per capita by year and country.
- Compare economic and demographic patterns by region.
- Examine the impact of literacy, infant mortality, and climate on development.
- Investigate net migration and emigration causes.
- Analyze the relationship between population, GDP, and area.
- Study the role of coastline ratio in development.

## 👥 Target Audience

- Data analysts and BI professionals  
- Researchers studying global development  
- Policy makers and economists  
- Academic evaluators or mentors

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Population size does not directly correlate with GDP.
- GDP per capita is a stronger measure of prosperity than total GDP.
- Literacy is highly associated with economic strength.
- Infant mortality decreases as literacy and GDP per capita increase.
- Coastline length does not guarantee economic development.
- Migration patterns are influenced mainly by economic conditions.
- Service sectors dominate high-income economies.
- Regional differences show varied development despite similar geographic traits.
